# Inventory Management System

## Overview

This is a full-stack inventory management system built with a modern web stack. The application provides real-time inventory tracking, product management, and dashboard analytics for businesses to monitor their stock levels and make informed decisions about their inventory.

## System Architecture

### Frontend Architecture
- **Framework**: React with TypeScript for type safety
- **Routing**: Wouter for lightweight client-side routing
- **State Management**: TanStack Query (React Query) for server state management
- **UI Framework**: Radix UI primitives with shadcn/ui components
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS with CSS variables for theming
- **Form Handling**: React Hook Form with Zod validation
- **Build Tool**: Vite for fast development and optimized builds

### Backend Architecture
- **Runtime**: Node.js with Express.js framework
- **Language**: TypeScript for full-stack type safety
- **API Design**: RESTful API endpoints with JSON responses
- **Database ORM**: Drizzle ORM for type-safe database operations
- **Database**: PostgreSQL (configured via Neon serverless)
- **Session Management**: Express sessions with PostgreSQL storage

### Data Storage Strategy
- **Primary Database**: PostgreSQL for relational data integrity
- **ORM**: Drizzle provides type-safe database queries and migrations
- **Schema Management**: Centralized schema definitions in `/shared/schema.ts`
- **Migration Strategy**: Drizzle Kit for database schema migrations

## Key Components

### Database Schema
The system uses four main entities:
- **Users**: Authentication and user management
- **Categories**: Product categorization system
- **Products**: Core inventory items with stock tracking
- **Inventory Adjustments**: Audit trail for stock changes

### Core Features
- **Dashboard Metrics**: Real-time inventory statistics and alerts
- **Product Management**: CRUD operations for inventory items
- **Stock Adjustments**: Tracking quantity changes with audit trail
- **Search & Filtering**: Product search by name, SKU, or category
- **Low Stock Alerts**: Configurable threshold-based notifications

### Authentication & Authorization
- Session-based authentication using Express sessions
- PostgreSQL session storage for scalability
- User management with username/password authentication

## Data Flow

1. **Client Requests**: React components make API calls using TanStack Query
2. **API Layer**: Express routes handle HTTP requests and validation
3. **Business Logic**: Server-side processing and data validation using Zod schemas
4. **Database Operations**: Drizzle ORM executes type-safe database queries
5. **Response**: JSON data returned to client with proper error handling
6. **UI Updates**: React Query manages cache invalidation and re-fetching

## External Dependencies

### Core Dependencies
- **@neondatabase/serverless**: Serverless PostgreSQL connection
- **drizzle-orm**: Type-safe database ORM
- **@tanstack/react-query**: Server state management
- **react-hook-form**: Form handling and validation
- **@hookform/resolvers**: Zod integration for form validation
- **wouter**: Lightweight React router

### UI Dependencies
- **@radix-ui/***: Headless UI primitives for accessibility
- **tailwindcss**: Utility-first CSS framework
- **lucide-react**: Icon library
- **class-variance-authority**: Component variant styling

### Development Dependencies
- **vite**: Build tool and dev server
- **typescript**: Type checking and compilation
- **tsx**: TypeScript execution for development

## Deployment Strategy

### Build Process
1. **Frontend Build**: Vite compiles React app to static assets in `/dist/public`
2. **Backend Build**: esbuild bundles Express server to `/dist/index.js`
3. **Database**: Drizzle migrations ensure schema is up-to-date

### Environment Configuration
- **Development**: Uses tsx for hot reloading of server code
- **Production**: Compiled JavaScript execution with Node.js
- **Database**: PostgreSQL connection via DATABASE_URL environment variable

### Hosting Considerations
- Frontend serves as static files through Express in production
- Backend API handles all `/api/*` routes
- Database requires PostgreSQL-compatible hosting (Neon, Supabase, etc.)
